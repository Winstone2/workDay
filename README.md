# workDay
Certainly! If you want to add a specific number of workdays (considering only Monday to Friday) to a given date using JavaScript, you can use the setDate function along with some conditional logic to skip weekends
the addWorkdays function takes a startDate (a Date object) and numWorkdays (the number of workdays to add) as arguments. It iterates through the days, skipping weekends, until the desired number of workdays are added.

Please note that this example assumes that you want to add workdays without considering holidays. If you need to consider holidays as well, you would need to include additional logic to skip those days.
